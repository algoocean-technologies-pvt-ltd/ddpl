          <button class="accordion">What is the right amount to spend when buying diamonds?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>The selection of beautiful diamonds is almost limitless today. For virtually every budget, there is an
              option that will surely please the one you love. So, what is the right number? If you're buying a diamond,
              the commonly accepted guideline for purchasing diamonds is two month's salary. That number may work for
              some people and not for others, but it's a good amount to start.</p>

          <button class="accordion">What makes a diamond beautiful? </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>It's all about diamond brilliance! Of the many characteristics of a diamond that contribute to its
              beauty, diamond brilliance is the most important. Diamond brilliance is defined as the reflection of a
              bright white light from the facets of the diamond and is determined by the artistry of the cutting and
              polishing. Each facet must be cut and shaped with precision, and placed with perfect symmetry.</p>

          <button class="accordion">Why should I buy an unset Diamond rather than a finished product?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>When it comes for diamond jewelry, you most probably invest in the Diamond and not in ring, earring etc.
              The price for setting is not relevant in comparison to the stone. You want the best stone possible for
              your money. How can you check that out? For this reason you can go with unset Diamond. By the way, never
              consult an appraiser that was recommended to you by someone else. Always choose yourself as per your
              requirement and budget.</p>

          <button class="accordion">Is it safe to get diamonds by courier?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Since we ship our diamonds by carriers like FedEx, the incidence of loss is generally no greater than
              with any other item you might ship. Additionally, all shipments are sent fully insured.</p>

          <div class="panel">
            <p>Diamonds are graded and priced according to what is universally referred to as the '4C's'. They are Cut,
              Color, Clarity and Carat weight. Each is a description of the various characteristics of a diamond. For
              example, Cut refers to the shape of the diamond, which affects its fire and brilliance. Color refers to
              the amount of color in the diamond (the less color a diamond has, the more valuable it is, all other
              factors being equal). Clarity describes the number of natural blemishes and inclusions a diamond has, and
              Carat Weight is simply a measurement of the diamond's weight (not its size).

          <button class="accordion">What's the best way to care for and clean a diamond? </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Here are some general guidelines for caring for and cleaning your diamonds: Avoid wearing your diamonds
              while doing housework, yard work or any other kind of rough work. Even though a diamond is extremely
              durable, a hard blow could chip it. Also, when doing household chores, never allow your Diamond to come
              into contact with chlorine bleach. The best way to clean your diamonds is in a bowl of warm, sudsy water
              with a bit of any mild liquid detergent. Brush the pieces with a soft brush, then transfer them to a wire
              or tea strainer and rinse with warm water. Dry with a soft lint-free cloth.

          <button class="accordion">How to Examine a Diamond?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>To accurately judge the quality of a diamond, it is advisable to use more than the naked eye. Here are
              common ways to examine a diamond.
              <b>Microscope/Loop</b> : To examine inclusions, one uses either a microscope or a 10x magnifying glass
              called a jeweler's loop. This enables one to see inclusions in stones. Most dealers will let you use
              theirs.
              <b>Diamond Tester</b> : A diamond tester uses light to verify that the stone you are examining is really a
              diamond. It does not guarantee quality -- just the type of stone. Most testers will still work when the
              stone is mounted.
              <b>Certification</b> : If you are unsure of your diamond knowledge or the jeweler you are buying from, get
              a certified Diamond. The best known and reliable certification is from GIA (Gemological Institute of
              America) or EGL (European Gemological Laboratory).
